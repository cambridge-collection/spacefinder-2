### History

Spacefinder was originally developed by the University of Cambridge in 2015 as part of the futurelib innovation programme, which explored the future role of academic libraries within the University.

<a target="external" href="https://spacefinder.lib.cam.ac.uk/">https://spacefinder.lib.cam.ac.uk/</a>

The code for the Ruby on Rails application which is used to create the site was released under an Apache 2.0 open source license in February 2022.

A rewrite of the code in the Cambridge application's UI was undertaken by the University of Leeds Library to make a single page application fed by JSON files which load data for all spaces (instead of loading them from a Rails API). The project was initiated to explore the possibility of using the Cambridge app in Leeds, where adoption of the full Rails stack was not possible.
