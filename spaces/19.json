  "description": "We can be tricky to find, so take a look at <https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/library/finding-us> before your first visit. In our small, but cosy, reading room you'll find large shared desks, four individual study spaces, a height-adjustable desk, bean bags and cushions, and an iDiscover terminal. This area may suit those who prefer working in a calm and quiet space. Visit our website for more information about our services, facilities (including location of toilets, these are also tricky to find!) and opening hours (these can vary, especially during the vacations).\n\nFï»¿or updates about the Library please see our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lewylibrary/)",
