  "description": "The North Front Corridor is a bright wide space o﻿n the first floor landing where readers and staff will often walk by. It's a cooler area with easy access to both the North Front and the North Wing. T﻿here are large tables to work at and views out with natural light coming in from the North Courtyard. There are no plug sockets on the tables, though electrical outlets are not far away on the wall opposite. You are free to work in the enclosure by the Tea Room and Map Room. The enclosure has two computers available for use and is a cosy study space. You can also access the North Courtyard, where food and drink can be taken and the Tea Room is not far away for those all important snack breaks. \n\nThere are often engaging exhibitions in the North Front and South Front corridors. The current exhibition is 'Footlights Illuminated', based on the university's famous comedy club. Find more information on the <a href=\"https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/footlights\">Footlights Illuminated exhibition' webpage</a> (https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/footlights).\n\n",
