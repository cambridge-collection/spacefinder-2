  "description": "The Reading Room South Corridor is a quiet corridor located next to the south courtyard. The supplementary catalogue is located here, and staff can be found in the Reading Room right next door. There is a printer/scanner located in the corridor and another by the Beta staircase.\n\nYou are within a short distance to the toilets and the tearoom is only a few minutes walk away. Though this is a corridor, it is a quieter corridor than some of the others and is usually not very busy.\n\nThe Library also offers: Book a Visit (to consult collections), Click & Collect, Scan & Deliver, Ask a Curator (special collections expertise). Follow the Website link at the bottom of this listing for more details and updates. https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/using-library/zero-contact-services",
