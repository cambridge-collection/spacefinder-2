  "description": "The Lower Ground Floor of the Library has some of the prettiest views in the Faculty. Study benches run the length of the windows overlooking the Faculty garden, where you can watch the squirrels, birds and sometimes ducks! \n\nThe Library Living Room (also on the Lower Ground Floor) gives you an opportunity to rest, refresh and recharge.  Be creative with colouring books, ponder our puzzles or charge up your phone!   You will also find laptop stands (there are a few scattered around the Library too), desk lamps for extra light or blankets if the weather turns a bit chilly – the Library is Not Just a Roomful of Books!  \n\n***For current Education Library opening hours, please email the Library team to check before your visit, particularly during vacations as times will change: [library@educ.cam.ac.uk](mailto:library@educ.cam.ac.uk)***\n\nFollow the Website link at the bottom of this listing for more details and updates. You can also find the library on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/edfaclib/).",
