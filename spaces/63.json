  "description": "The UL Tea Room is a great place to meet up with friends and take a break from work. The atmosphere is chatty and social. The Tea Room is also suitable for taking phone calls/meetings. You can treat yourself to barista coffee, and a daily-changing variety of sandwiches, paninis, snacks and cakes. Serving hours are 9am to 3pm. You are also welcome to eat your own food in the Tea Room. Users without their own water bottle can ask for a paper cup from the Reader Services Desk in the Entrance Hall, in order to use the cooler.",
