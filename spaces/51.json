  "description": "The South Reading Room is a very comfortable and cosy space with plenty of soft seating. This is a very quiet space with access to bookable acoustic booths and coffee tables. The toilets are just around the corner and you are within equal distance to both the Main Reading Room and the Readers Services Desk; both of which are constantly staffed. The help desk is also just outside, and printers and scanners are not far away, the nearest being in the South Reading Room Corridor.\n\nThe Library also offers: Book a Visit (to consult collections), Click & Collect, Scan & Deliver, Ask a Curator (special collections expertise).
