  "description": "The South Reading Room is a very comfortable and cosy space with plenty of soft sofas and chairs. This is a quiet space with access to three acoustic booths and coffee tables. Two of the booths can be booked online on the <a href=\"https://calendars.libraries.cam.ac.uk/calendar/acousticbooths?cid=8562&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=8562&inc=0\">LibCal calendar</a> whilst the other booth operates on a walk-in basis.  (https://calendars.libraries.cam.ac.uk/calendar/acousticbooths?cid=8562&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=8562&inc=0).  \n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe toilets are just around the corner and you are within equal distance to the Main Reading Room and the Readers Services Desk; both of which are constantly staffed. The help desk is just outside on the first-floor landing. There is a printer/scanner at the end of the Reading Room South Corridor. You will often find book displays in this room, which showcase our wide variety of legal deposit material.  \n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe Library also offers z﻿ero-contact services such as : C﻿lick & Collect and Scan & Deliver. You can find more information on these services through our <a href=\"https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/using-library/zero-contact-services\">Zero Contact Services webpage</a>.
